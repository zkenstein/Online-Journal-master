# Purpose:
A secret diary or a private journal of ideas, notes and pictures that could be accessible from anywhere.<br>
The main motivation was secrecy, maintaining a diary in the hostel was tough because friends visited the<br> 
rooms day in and day out and in such a scenario maintaining a secret diary was almost impossible. So I made<br> 
made an online journal where in every user would get a private space to express their feelings freely.<br> 
We introduced themes so that users could add pictures, personalize their private space according to their<br> 
moods and very importantly we encrypted their data. This project was based on Database Management System.<br>
